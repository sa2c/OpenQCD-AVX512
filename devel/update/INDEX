HMC algorithm

check1        Check of the program set_mdsteps().

check2        Reversibility of the MD evolution.

check3        Conservation of the Hamilton function by the MD evolution.

check4        Check of add_chrono() and get_chrono().

check5        Comparison of rwtm*() with action1().

check6        Comparison of rwtm*eo() with action4().

The programs check5 and check6 accept the option -bc <type> that allows the
type of boundary condition to be chosen at runtime. When the option is not
set, open boundary conditions are assumed.

The option may be set but has no effect in the case of the other programs. In
the case of check2 and check3, the boundary conditions are selected through
the input parameter file.
