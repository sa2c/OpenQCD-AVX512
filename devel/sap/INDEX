Schwarz Alternating Procedure (SAP) and SAP_GCR solver

check1        Check of the block solver programs.

check2        Direct test of the Schwarz alternating procedure.

check3        Check and performance of the SAP+GCR solver.

time1         Timing of blk_mres() and blk_eo_mres().

time2         Timing of the SAP preconditioner.

The programs check1, check2, time1 and time2 accept the option -bc <type> that
allows the type of boundary condition to be chosen at runtime. When the option
is not set, open boundary conditions are assumed.

The option may be set but has no effect in the case of check3 (the boundary
conditions are selected through the input parameter file in this case).
