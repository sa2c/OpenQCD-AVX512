Programs for the O(a)-improved Wilson-Dirac operator.

check1        Gauge covariance of Dw().

check2        Action of Dw() on plane waves.

check3        Hermiticity of Dw() and comparison with
              Dwee(),..,Dwhat().

check4        Gauge covariance of Dw_dble().

check5        Action of Dw_dble() on plane waves.

check6        Hermiticity of Dw_dble() and comparison with
              Dwee_dble(),..,Dwhat_dble().

check7        Comparison of Dw_blk() with Dw().

check8        Comparison of Dw_blk_dble() with Dw_dble().

check9        Comparison of Dw_bnd() with Dw().

time1         Timing of Dw() and Dwhat().

time2         Timing of Dw_dble() and Dwhat_dble().

time3         Timing of Dw_blk() and Dwhat_blk().

time4         Timing of Dw_blk_dble() and Dwhat_blk_dble().

The programs check1,..,time4 accept the option -bc <type> that allows the
type of boundary condition to be chosen at runtime. When the option is not
set, open boundary conditions are assumed.
