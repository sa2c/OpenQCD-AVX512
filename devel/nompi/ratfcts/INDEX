check1    Computation of the complete elliptic integral K(k)

check2    Computation of the Jacobi elliptic functions sn,cn,dn

check3    Zolotarev rational approximation to the sign function

table1    Table of the relative error of the Zolotarev rational 
          approximation to the function f(x)=1/|x| (suitable for
          plotting, for example)
