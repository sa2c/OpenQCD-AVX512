Checking a non-MPI function that should also be usable in an MPI
program requires a replacement for the basic utility functions. The
associated modules and include files are found in the modules/nompi
and include/nompi directories.

Currently the directories with the check programs are 

extras           Modified Bessel function

forces           Generic functions for MD force calculations

linalg           Generic complex matrix operations

main             Simple analysis programs for the data files produced by 
                 the programs in the directory main

random           Random number generator

ratfcts          Rational approximations

su3fcts          SU(3) exponential function, SU(3) products, ...

sw_term          Pauli matrix operations

utils            Byte swapping
