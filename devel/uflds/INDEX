Allocation and initialization of the global gauge fields.

check1        Initialization of the link variables.

check2        Renormalization of the link variables.

check3        Check of the program that translates the double-precsion 
              gauge field.

check4        Check of the programs for the plaquette sums of the 
              double-precision gauge field.

check5        Check of the program set_bstap().

All programs accept the option -bc <type> that allows the type of boundary
condition to be chosen. When the option is not set, open boundary conditions
are assumed.
