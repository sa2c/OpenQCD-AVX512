Little Dirac operator

check1        Check of the programs in the module Aw_gen.c.

check2        Check of the program  b2b_flds().

check3        Direct check of Aw_dble() and Aw().

check4        Consistency checks on Aw_dble(),..,Awhat().

check5        Check of the program set_ltl_modes().

time1         Timing of Awhat().

The programs check2,..,time1 accept the option -bc <type> that allows the
type of boundary condition to be chosen at runtime. When the option is not
set, open boundary conditions are assumed.

The option may be set but has no effect in the case of check1.
