Block grid allocation and field assignment programs

check1        Checks on the local geometry arrays b.ipt,b.iup,b.idn,
              b.imb,b.ibp and b.bb.ipp,b.bb.map,b.bb.imb for the
              known block grids. This program also checks ipt_blk().

check2        Checks on the allocation and initialization of the gauge,
              Dirac and Weyl fields on the known block grids.

check3        Check of assign_ud2ubgr() and assign_ud2udblk().

check4        Check of assign_swd2swbgr() and assign_swd2swdblk().

check5        Check of assign_s2sblk(),...,assign_sdblk2sd().

The programs check1, check3 and check4 accept the option -bc <type> that
allows the type of boundary condition to be chosen at runtime. When the option
is not set, open boundary conditions are assumed.

The option may be set but has no effect in the case of the other programs.
