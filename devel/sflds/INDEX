Basic utility programs for spinor fields

check1        Check of the programs in the module sflds.c.

check2        Check of the communication programs in scom.c and sdcom.c.

The program check2 accepts the option -bc <type> that allows the type of
boundary condition to be chosen at runtime. When the option is not set, open
boundary conditions are assumed.

The option may be set but has no effect in the case of check1.
