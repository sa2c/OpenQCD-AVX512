Lattice geometry and boundary conditions.

check1        Consistency checks on the global index arrays cpr,...,map.

check2        Check of the programs set_bc() and check_bc().

check3        Check of the programs bnd_s2zero() and bnd_sd2zero().

Checks on the block geometry programs are included in the directory
devel/block.

The programs check2 and check3 accept the option -bc <type> that allows the
type of boundary condition to be chosen at runtime. When the option is not
set, open boundary conditions are assumed.

The option may be set but has no effect in the case of check1.
