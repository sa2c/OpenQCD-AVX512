This directory contains the check programs for the various modules.
They should better be executed, for the chosen lattice parameters,
before a simulation is started.

The check programs for some of the program files that do not use the
MPI library (such as the random number generators) are included in the
directory "nompi". All other directories correspond to the module
directories with the same name, and the check programs in these are
MPI main programs.
