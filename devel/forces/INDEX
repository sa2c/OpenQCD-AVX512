Except for check5 and check8, all programs accept the option -bc <type> that
allows the type of boundary condition to be chosen at runtime. When the option
is not set, open boundary conditions are assumed.

The option may be set but has no effect in the case of check5 and check8 (the
boundary conditions are selected through the input parameter file in these
cases).
