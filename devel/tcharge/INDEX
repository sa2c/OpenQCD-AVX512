Computation of the topological charge and the Yang-Mills action.

check1         Check of the translation and gauge invariance of the 
               topological charge.

check2         Topological charge of constant abelian background fields.

check3         Check of the program tcharge_slices().

check4         Check of the translation and gauge invariance of the 
               Yang-Mills action.

check5         Yang-Mills action of constant abelian background fields.

check6         Check of the program ym_action_slices().

All programs accept the option -bc <type> that allows the type of boundary
condition to be chosen. When the option is not set, open boundary conditions
are assumed.
