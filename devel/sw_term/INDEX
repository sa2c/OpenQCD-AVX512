check1        Allocation, assignment and inversion of the global SW arrays.

check2        Check of the gauge covariance of the SW term.

check3        Check of the SW term for abelian background fields.

All programs accept the option -bc <type> that allows the type of boundary
condition to be chosen. When the option is not set, open boundary conditions
are assumed.
