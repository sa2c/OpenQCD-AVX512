Integration of the Wilson flow

check1        Basic checks on the implementation of the Wilson flow.

check2        Gauge covariance of the Wilson flow.

check3        Convergence of the numerical integration.

The programs check1 and check2 accept the option -bc <type> that allows the
type of boundary condition to be chosen (open boundary conditions are assumed
if the option is not set). In the case of check3, the boundary conditions are
set through the input parameter file.
