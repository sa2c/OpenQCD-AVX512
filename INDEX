At the top level, the openQCD package is structured as follows: 

devel            Directories used for developing and testing the various 
                 modules

doc              Documentation files

include          All include files. Typically there is one include file
                 per directory in the modules directory

main             Collection of main programs

modules          Source code of all modules 

In addition to the information provided by the notes in the doc directory,
short descriptions of the program functionalities are included in the source
directories and at the top of each program file. Further information is found
in various README files (such as main/README.global).
