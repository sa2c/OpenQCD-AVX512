An optimized version of openQCD-1.6 for Intel processors with 512 bit vector width
==================================================================================

DESCRIPTION

   This code extends openQCD-1.6 with an implementation of the Dirac operator
   with intel Intrincic operations in order to use the full vector width on Intel
   Skylake, Knight Landing and other processors.

   The extension is enabled with the -DAVX521 flag in CFLAGS in the Makefiles.

   To enable assembly versions pre-compiled for Skylake Xeon Scalable CPUs also include -DAVX512_ASM in CFLAGS.
