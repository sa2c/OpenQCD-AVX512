Version 1.6: 4th public release.

- Added phase-periodic boundary conditions in the space directions for
  the quark fields (thanks to Isabel Campos). See doc/dirac.pdf and
  doc/parms.pdf for details.

- The function chs_ubnd() [lattice/bcnds.c] has been removed since its
  functionality is now contained in set_ud_phase() and unset_ud_phase()
  [uflds/uflds.c].

- The error functions have been moved to a new module utils/error.c and
  the error_loc() function has been changed so that it calls MPI_Abort()
  when an error occurs in the calling MPI process. There is then no use
  for the error_chk() function anymore and so it has been removed.

- There is a new module utils/hsum.c providing generic hierarchical
  summation routines. These are now used in most programs where such
  sums are performed, thus leading to an important simplification of
  the programs (see linalg/salg_dble.c, for example).

- Corrected flags/rw_parms.c so as to get rid of compiler warnings when
  NPROC=1.

- Corrected notes in utils/endian.c.

- In main/ym1.c delete superfluous second call of alloc_data() in the
  main program.

- In main/ms4.c replaced "x0=(N0-1)" by "x0==(N0-1)" on line 185 and
  "if (sp.solver==SAP_GCR)" by "else if (sp.solver==SAP_GCR)" on line
  491 (thanks to Abdou Abdel-Rehim for noting this bug).

- In random/ranlux.c inserted error message in check_machine() to
  make sure the number of actual MPI processes matches NPROC.

- In the main programs qcd1.c and ym1.c interchanged the order of init_ud()
  and init_rng().

- Corrected avx.h in order to get rid of some Intel compiler warnings.

- Corrected a bug in cmat_vec() and cmat_vec_assign() [linalg/cmatrix.c]
  that could lead to a segmentation fault if the option -DAVX is set,
  the argument "n" is odd and if the matrix "a" is not aligned to a 16
  byte boundary (thanks to Agostino Patella).

- Corrected the use of alignment data attributes so as to fully comply
  with the syntactic rules described in the gcc manuals.

- Reworked the module su3fcts/chexp.c in order to make it safer against
  aggressively optimizing compilers.

- Included the AVX su3_multiply_dble and su3_inverse_multiply_dble macros
  in the module su3fcts/su3prod.c. Modified the inline assembly code in
  prod2su3alg() in order to make it safer against aggressively optimizing
  compilers.

- Included new inline assembly code in avx.h that makes use of fused
  multiply-add (FMA3) instructions. These can be activated by setting
  the compiler option -DFMA3 together with -DAVX. Several modules now
  include such instructions, notably cmatrix.c, cmatrix_dble.c, salg.c
  and salg_dble.c.

- Adapted all check programs to the changes in the modules.

- Modified devel/nompi/su3fcts/time1.c so as to more accurately measure
  the time required for su3xsu3_vector multiplications.

- Added an "LFLAGS" variable to the Makefiles that allows the compiler
  options in the link step to be set to a value different from CFLAGS.

- Revised the documentation files doc/dirac.pdf and doc/parms.pdf.

- Revised the top README file.

- Revised modules/flags/README.


22. April 2014

Version 1.4: 3rd public release.

- Changed the way SF boundary conditions are implemented so that the time
  extent of the lattice is now NPROC0*L0 rather than NPROC0*L0-1.

- Adapted all modules and main programs so as to support four types of
  boundary conditions (open, SF, open-SF and periodic). For detailed
  explanations see main/README.global, doc/gauge_action.pdf, doc/dirac.pdf,
  and doc/parms.pdf.

- The form of the gauge action near the boundaries of the lattice with SF
  boundary conditions has been slightly modified with respect to the choice
  made in version 1.2 (see doc/gauge_action.pdf; the modification only
  concerns actions with double-plaquette terms).

- The programs for the light-quark reweighting factors now support
  twisted-mass Hasenbusch decompositions into products of factors. In the
  program main/ms1.c, the factorization (if any) can be specified through the
  input parameter file. NOTE: the layout of the data on the output data file
  produced by ms1.c had to be changed with respect to openQCD-1.2.

- Slightly modified the program main/ms2.c so as to allow for different
  power-method iteration numbers when estimating the lower and upper
  end of the spectrum of the Dirac operator (see main/README.ms2).

- Removed flags/sf_parms.c since the functionality of this module is now
  included in lat_parms.c.

- Updated documentation files gauge_action.pdf, dirac.pdf, parms.pdf and
  rhmc.pdf.

- In main/ms4.in and main/qcd1.in replaced "[Deflation projectors]" by
  "[Deflation projection]".

- Removed main/qcd2.c since main/qcd1.c now includes the case of SF boundary
  conditions.

- Corrected all check programs in ./devel/* so as to take into account the
  different choices of boundary conditions. Many check programs now have a
  command line option -bc <type> that allows the type of boundary condition to
  be specified at run time.

- Corrected a bug in Dwee_dble() [modules/dirac/Dw_dbl.c] that shows up in
  some check programs if none of the local lattice sizes L1,L2,L3 is divisible
  by 4. The functionality of the other modules and the main programs in ./main
  was not affected by this bug, because Dwee_dble() is not called in any of
  these programs.

- Corrected modules/flags/rw_parms.c so as to allow for Hasenbusch factorized
  reweighting factors.

- Corrected and improved the descriptions at the top of many module files.

- Corrected devel/ratfcts/INDEX.

- Added forgotten "plots" directory in devel/nompi/main.

- Replaced &irat in MPI_Bcast(&irat,3,MPI_INT,0,MPI_COMM_WORLD) by irat in
  flags/force_parms.c [read_forc_parms() and read_force_parms2()]. This is not
  a mistake but an unnatural and unintended use of the C language. Corrected
  analogous cases in a number of check programs (thanks to Hubert Simma and
  Georg Engel for noting these misprints).

- Corrected check program block/check1.c (the point labeling does not need to
  respect any time ordering).


12. May 2013

Version 1.2: 2nd public release.

- Added AVX inline-assembly to the time-critical functions (Dirac operator,
  linear algebra, SAP preconditioner, SU(3) functions). See the README file in
  the top directory of the distribution.

- Added support for blocked MPI process ranking, as is likely to be profitable
  on parallel computers with mult-core nodes (see main/README.global).

- Made the field import/export functions more efficient by avoiding the
  previously excessive use of MPI_Barrier().

- Added import/export functions for the state of the random number generators.
  Modified the initialization of the generators so as to be independent of the
  ranking of the MPI processes. See the notes in modules/random/ranlux.c. Added
  a check program in devel/random.

- Continuation runs of qcd1,qcd2,ym1 and ms1 now normally reset the random
  number generators to their state at the end of the previous run. The
  programs initialize the generators in the traditional way if the option
  -norng is set (see README.qcd1, for example).

- Modified the deflated SAP+GCR solver (dfl/dfl_sap_gcr.c) by replacing the
  deflation projectors through an inaccurate projection in the preconditioner
  (as suggested by Frommer et al. [arXiv:1303:1377]; the deflation subspace
  type and subspace generation algorithm are unchanged). This leads to a
  structural simplification and, after some parameter tuning, to a slight
  performance gain. NOTE: the deflation parameter set is changed too and the
  number of status variables is reduced by 1 (see modules/flags/dfl_parms.c,
  modules/dfl/dfl_sap_gcr.c and doc/parms.pdf).

- Included a program (devel/dfl/check4.c) that allows the parameters of the
  deflated SAP+GCR solver to be tuned on a given lattice.

- Deleted the now superfluous module/dfl/dfl_projectors.c.

- Added the function fdigits() [utils/mutils.c] that allows double-precision
  floating point numbers to be printed with all significant decimal digits
  (and only these). The main programs make use of this function to ensure that
  the values of the decimal parameters are printed to the log files with as
  many significant digits as were given on the input parameter file (assuming
  not more digits were specified than can be represented by a double number).

- Replaced "if" by "else if" on line 379 of main/ms2.c. This bug stopped the
  program with an error message when the CGNE solver was used. It had no
  effect when other solvers were used.

- Changed the type of the variable "sf" to "int" in lines 257 and 440 of
  forces/force0.c. This bug had no effect in view of the automatic type
  conversions performed by the compiler.

- Corrected sign in line 174 of devel/sap/check2.c. This bug led to wrong
  check results, thus incorrectly suggesting that the SAP modules were
  incorrect.

- Corrected a mistake in devel/tcharge/check2.c and devel/tcharge/check5.c
  that gave rise to wrong results suggesting that the tested modules were
  incorrect.
